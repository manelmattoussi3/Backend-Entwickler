The code demonstrates the creation of a backend application that handles a FizzBuzz logic implementation using Spring Boot and JPA (Java Persistence API).

FizzBuzzResult Entity
This entity defines the structure of a FizzBuzzResult object persisted in the database. It includes:

idFizz: An identifier field marked with @Id to represent the unique ID of the FizzBuzz result.
value: A field that holds the result of the FizzBuzz logic.
FizzBuzzIService Interface
This interface declares a method signature generateFizzBuzzList responsible for generating a list of FizzBuzz results based on a given number.

FizzBuzzService Implementation
The FizzBuzzService class implements the FizzBuzzIService interface. It generates the FizzBuzz results using the generateFizzBuzzList method by iterating from 1 to the provided number. It determines Fizz, Buzz, or FizzBuzz based on the number's divisibility by 3 and 5.

FizzBuzzController REST Controller
This controller exposes an endpoint at /api/fizzbuzz/{number} that triggers the FizzBuzz generation logic. It injects the FizzBuzzIService and retrieves the generated FizzBuzz list for a given number provided in the URL.
